            Snickers was my first baby girl, I got her when she was 6 months old.  From the moment we met she was my best friend.

            She was a very sweet and smart Pomeranian, I always joked about her short fur, then seems like oneday she was a puff ball!

            We lost her to kidney failure when she was just 8 years old.  I am so glad my husband Todd got the chance to meet her for the short time she was with me.  She is and always will be a very special part of me.
